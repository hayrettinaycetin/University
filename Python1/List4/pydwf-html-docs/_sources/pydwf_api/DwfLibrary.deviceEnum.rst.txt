Device enumeration functionality
================================

The device enumeration functionality provides a way to enumerate accessible Digilent Waveforms devices, i.e., probe the USB bus and the network to find all Digilent Waveforms devices that can potentially be used.

The enumeration functionality also provides functionality to get basic information for all devices found, such as the device type, hardware revision, and serial number.

Lastly, the enumeration functionality allows user programs to examine |device configurations:link|, which provide a way to optimize the Digilent Waveforms device for a certain task by allocating resources such as buffer memory to certain instruments.

Using the device enumeration functionality
------------------------------------------

To use the device enumeration functionality you first need to initialize a |DwfLibrary:link| instance. The device enumeration functionality can then be accessed via its |deviceEnum:link| attribute, which is an instance of the |DeviceEnumeration:link| class:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydwf import DwfLibrary

   dwf = DwfLibrary()

   # Enumerate all Digilent Waveforms devices and return the count.
   device_count = dwf.deviceEnum.enumerateDevices()

   print("Number of Digilent Waveforms devices found:", device_count)

Alternatives to the device enumeration functionality
----------------------------------------------------

For most users, there is little reason to use the device enumeration API directly. Consider the following alternatives:

* From the command line, it is easy to obtain a list of all Digilent Waveforms devices and their configurations like this:

  .. code-block:: sh

     python -m pydwf list -c

* For Python scripts that want to select a specific device by serial number, or want to select a specific |device configuration:link| while opening the device to maximize the capabilities of a certain instrument (for example, to open the device with the largest possible |AnalogIn| or |AnalogOut| sample buffer sizes), consider using the |pydwf.utilities.openDwfDevice:link| convenience function.
