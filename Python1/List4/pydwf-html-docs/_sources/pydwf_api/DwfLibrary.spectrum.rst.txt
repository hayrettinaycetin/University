Signal processing functionality
===============================

The signal processing functionality provides several standard functions for processing digitized analog signals.


Using the signal processing functionality
-----------------------------------------

To use the signal processing functionality you first need to initialize a |DwfLibrary:link| instance. The signal processing functionality can then be accessed via its |spectrum:link| attribute, which is an instance of the |Spectrum:link| class:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydwf import DwfLibrary, DwfWindow

   dwf = DwfLibrary()

   # Make an 11-element Hamming window.
   (hamming_window, noise_equivalent_bandwidth) = dwf.spectrum.window(11, DwfWindow.Hamming)

|Spectrum| reference
--------------------

.. autoclass:: pydwf.core.api.spectrum.Spectrum()
   :inherited-members:
