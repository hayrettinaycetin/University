SPI protocol
============

The SPI protocol support allows a Digilent Waveforms device to be used as a simple `SPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface>`_ bus master.

    **This section is currently incomplete.**

    It does not properly explain the meaning of some of the settings that influence the behavior of the SPI functionality, and the difference between the several write/read methods.

Using the SPI protocol functionality
------------------------------------

To use the SPI protocol functionality you first need to initialize a |DwfLibrary| instance. Next, you open a specific device. The device's SPI protocol functionality can now be accessed via its |protocol.spi:link| attribute, which is an instance of the |ProtocolSPI:link| class:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydwf import DwfLibrary
   from pydwf.utilities import openDwfDevice

   dwf = DwfLibrary()

   with openDwfDevice(dwf) as device:
       spi = device.protocol.spi
       spi.reset()
