CAN protocol
============

The CAN protocol support allows a Digilent Waveforms device to be used as a simple `CAN bus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus>`_ device.

    **This section is currently incomplete.**

    A bit of background on CAN would be helpful.

    This section does not yet properly explain the *polarity* setting.

    It also does not yet explain the *vID*, *extended*, and *remote* parameters / return values used in the *rx()* and *tx()* methods.

Using the CAN protocol functionality
------------------------------------

To use the CAN protocol functionality you first need to initialize a |DwfLibrary| instance. Next, you open a specific device. The device's CAN protocol functionality can now be accessed via its |protocol.can:link| attribute, which is an instance of the |ProtocolCAN:link| class:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydwf import DwfLibrary
   from pydwf.utilities import openDwfDevice

   dwf = DwfLibrary()

   with openDwfDevice(dwf) as device:
       can = device.protocol.can
       can.reset()
