UART protocol
=============

The UART protocol support allows a Digilent Waveforms device to be used as a simple Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (`UART <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter>`_).

    **This section is currently incomplete.**

    Specifically, the meaning of the parity error indication as returned by the :py:meth:`rx() <pydwf.core.api.protocol.uart.rx>` method is unclear.
    It needs to be investigated and documented.

Using the UART protocol functionality
-------------------------------------

To use the UART protocol functionality you first need to initialize a |DwfLibrary| instance. Next, you open a specific device. The device's UART protocol functionality can now be accessed via its |protocol.uart:link| attribute, which is an instance of the |ProtocolUART:link| class:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydwf import DwfLibrary
   from pydwf.utilities import openDwfDevice

   dwf = DwfLibrary()

   with openDwfDevice(dwf) as device:
       uart = device.protocol.uart
       uart.reset()

The UART protocol as implemented supports a single digital pin to act as a transmitter (TX), and a single digital pin to act as a receiver (RX). Transmission and reception are relative to the viewpoint of the Digilent Waveforms device; so 'transmission' means that the Digilent Waveforms device sends outgoing data, and 'reception' means that the Digilent Waveforms device receives incoming data.

The UART protocol only supports the two basic serial TX and RX signals. Other signals commonly encountered on serial ports (e.g., hardware handshaking using RTS/CTS) are not supported.

Note that while the UART API provides several methods to configure the serial communication (most notably, the baudrate, number of data-bits, parity, and number of stop-bits), there is no way to read back the currently active communication parameter values.
