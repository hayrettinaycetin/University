SWD protocol
============

The SWD protocol support allows a Digilent Waveforms device to be used as a simple SWD (Serial Wire Debug) device.

    A bit of background on SWD would be helpful.

Using the SWD protocol functionality
------------------------------------

To use the SWD protocol functionality you first need to initialize a |DwfLibrary| instance. Next, you open a specific device. The device's SWD protocol functionality can now be accessed via its |protocol.swd:link| attribute, which is an instance of the |ProtocolSWD:link| class:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydwf import DwfLibrary
   from pydwf.utilities import openDwfDevice

   dwf = DwfLibrary()

   with openDwfDevice(dwf) as device:
       swd = device.protocol.swd
       swd.reset()
