I²C protocol
============

The I²C protocol support allows a Digilent Waveforms device to be used as a simple `I²C <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C>`_ bus master.

    It does not properly explain some of the settings that influence the behavior of the I²C functionality, and the difference between the several write/read methods.

Using the I²C protocol functionality
------------------------------------

To use the I²C protocol functionality you first need to initialize a |DwfLibrary| instance. Next, you open a specific device. The device's I²C protocol functionality can now be accessed via its |protocol.i2c:link| attribute, which is an instance of the |ProtocolI2C:link| class:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydwf import DwfLibrary
   from pydwf.utilities import openDwfDevice

   dwf = DwfLibrary()

   with openDwfDevice(dwf) as device:
       i2c = device.protocol.i2c
       i2c.reset()
