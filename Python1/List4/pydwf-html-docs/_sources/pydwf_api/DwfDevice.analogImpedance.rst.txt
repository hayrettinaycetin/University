Analog impedance measurements
=============================

The |AnalogImpedance| functionality supports analog measurements of signal propagation properties on devices that support it, such as the Analog Discovery and the Analog Discovery 2.

    **This section is currently incomplete.**

    It lacks information on the state machine used in the |AnalogImpedance| API, what the different settings mean, what the different methods actually do, and how they can be used to perform measurements.

    There are also no |AnalogImpedance| examples yet.

Using the analog impedance measurements
---------------------------------------

To use the |AnalogImpedance| functionality you first need to initialize a |DwfLibrary| instance. Next, you open a specific device. The device's |AnalogImpedance| functionality can now be accessed via its |analogImpedance:link| attribute, which is an instance of the |AnalogImpedance:link| class.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

   from pydwf import DwfLibrary
   from pydwf.utilities import openDwfDevice

   dwf = DwfLibrary()

   with openDwfDevice(dwf) as device:

       # Get a reference to the device's AnalogImpedance functionality.
       analogImpedance = device.analogImpedance

       # Use the AnalogImpedance functionality.
       analogImpedance.reset()
